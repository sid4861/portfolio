            This blogpost is based on the chapter from the amazing book <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html" target="_blank" style="color: #10B981; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Eloquent Javascript</a>.
            Do check this book out for learning JS.

        <h4>What are functions ?</h4>
        <p>
            The most simple and relatable definition would be, a function is just a group of code which you can give a
            name (also known as binding) and use that name to invoke this functionality anytime.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why would anyone want to use functions and not just write programs line after line ?</strong>
            <br />
            Below are some of this benefits and uses of functions.
        <ul>
            <li>Functions help to structure your programs. As people write software, the amount of code and the
                documentation becomes huge. In such a situation it important to divide the program into logical unit
                called functions, which eventually make the code much more readable and find bugs later on.
            </li>
            <li>
                Functions help to reduce repetition. If you come across a use case or task which would be required in
                the software at different locations and situations, you can isolate the such code into a function, and
                instead of writing the whole code again, just invoke the function. It is a huge time saver, also reduces
                the number of bugs that would be introduced when writing the whole code manually.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>How do you define functions in javascript ?</strong>
            <p>
                Before discussing ways to define a function, just remember that functions can have a set of parameters (a function without any paramaters is also valid) and a body, the code that the function executes wrapped in curly braces
            </p>

        <p>
            There are 3 ways of doing so
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Create a function and assign it to a variable</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
                Below code illustrates this method
            </p>
            <code>
                    const square = function(x) 
                    <br/>{
                        return x * x;
                      };
                      <br/>
                      console.log(square(12));
                      // â†’ 144
                </code>
            <li>
                <strong>Declaration Notation</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
                There is a slightly shorter way to create a function binding.
                Below code illustrates this method
            </p>
            <code>
                function square(x) <br/>{
                    return x * x;<br/>
                  }
            </code>
            <li>
                <strong>Arrow functions</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
                it uses an arrow (=>) made up of an equal sign and a greater-than character and can be used to create concise functions, showm below - 
            </p>
            <code>
                const square = x => x*x; 
            </code>
            <p>
                Carefully observing the above code snippet, one can interpret that if the functions accepts only 1 parameter, it need not be enclosed in paranthesis, also if the body contains just one statement, we can omit the return key word and write the statement in the same line.
            </p>
        </ol>
